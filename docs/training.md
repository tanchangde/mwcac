# 农民工职业技能培训

Vocational training is the most effective way for migrant workers to build competencies in job market. In China, universities, community colleges, private training agencies, technical schools, trade unions and local communities are offering many programs of adult education and vocational training. Chinese governments each year spend big money to support some training programs specifically designed for migrant workers. Some companies also sponsor such programs or offer onsite apprentice/trainee programs in their own construction sites or production facilities.

Since the vocational trainings are offered or organized by so many different authorities and agencies, it is difficult for migrant workers to access to the training information, and identify the right learning opportunities for them. MWCAC has developed a consolidated list of all vocational training agency in Shanghai. We can provide you with the contacts for your direct communication with the agencies. Our staffs and volunteers can also select agencies and programs for you, based on your background and requirement. Most importantly, we will analyze your situation and recommend the best training solutions for you, to ensure an effective learning experience, which will enable you to achieve expected career goals. After you complete your training, you can use our Job Placement services to continue your career development journey with us.
