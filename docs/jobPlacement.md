# 农民工找工作

Using the popular job listing websites in China for job search may not be a good solution for migrant workers. A commercial job agency often focuses its attention on high end jobs. MWCAC builds partnerships with some employment agency specializing at job opportunities for migrant workers. We also work with some government sponsored agencies with services solely for migrant workers’ job placement. We communicate with those specialized or dedicated agencies on regular basis, referring selected migrant workers in our database to them and follow up with their actions. We have some of the job listing websites below. You may directly go to the sites for their services or contact us for assistance.
