Migrant workers refer to agricultural labors in rural hinterland of China coming to work in big cities. They are the cheap labors and the lowest earners in society. They build some of the world's greatest skylines. But they don't take part in the life of the cities they build.

Jasper Liu is a high school student in Shanghai American School (SAS). Starting from his Pre-K in SAS, he often visited a school for migrant workers’ children (migrant children), not far away from SAS. Together with other students in SAS, he participated in many activities organized by SAS to help the students in that migrant children school. They donated clothes, sport equipment, text books etc.; tutored English; and had joint after school activities with the migrant children. He knew from every beginning that life is not easy for those migrant workers’ families, and decided to help. Among other difficulties, the biggest challenge is the career development of migrant worker in big cities like Shanghai. Jasper did research about the job markets for migrant workers for many years and eventually came up with the idea of Migrant Workers Career Assistant Center (MWCAC).

MWCAC is a not-for-profit organization. It is the first organization providing one-stop services helping migrant workers in Shanghai with their career development in big cities. By coordinating and working with our partners, MWCAC delivers integrated solutions to help migrant workers access to government and private resources for vocational training, job placement, financial support and legal aids.
