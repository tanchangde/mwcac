We need volunteers to communicate with migrant workers about their requirement and offer assistance; update our database for migrant worker information, apply for vocational training programs; prepare documents for financial aids and legal aids; and refer migrant workers to job agency and companies. Please register yourself as volunteer now and find out how you can help! We can accommodate all kinds of schedules.
